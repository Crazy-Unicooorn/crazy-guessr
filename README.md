# CrazyGuessr

[CrazyGuessr](https://crazy-unicooorn.github.io/crazy-guessr/) is a set of tips and tools to help you get better at [GeoGuessr](https://geoguessr.com/).

It takes a new approach by offering **Training Cards** games and linking to practice maps for each tip section.

This is to make the learning process as optimal as can be.

_The project is hosted on Github Pages, which is a free service for static websites. This means that we are trying to keep the website simple and easy to use. We will not include features that would require a server, such as leaderboards._
