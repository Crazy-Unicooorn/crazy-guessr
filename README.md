# CrazyGuessr

[CrazyGuessr](https://crazy-unicooorn.github.io/crazy-guessr/) is a set of tips and tools to help you get better at [GeoGuessR](geoguessr.com/).

It takes a new approach by offering _Recall Training_ and linking to practice maps for each tip section.

This is to make the learning process as optimal as can be.

**The project is hosted on Github Pages, which is a free service for static websites. This means that we are trying to keep the website simple and will not include features that would require a server, such as leaderboards.**
